# Gwenily's List

- **Please ensure you use [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) to access most of the websites listed here**, otherwise, you will have a bad time. (To be honest, you should always have this in general).
- Notice any typos, errors, broken links, or out of date info? Have suggestions or questions? Please [check here](https://github.com/gwenily/gwenilys-list/issues) and open an issue if someone else hasn't mentioned your comment already!

## What is this list, How do i use it?
- This list is basically just a collection of things I personally use, or think are useful, cool, or neat! I made it to both shine light on things I think deserve more attention, and to provide those I know with a useful list about how to do things or what services are good.
- Some items in this list could easily fit in more than one category, so to make sure you find what you're looking for please use `Ctrl + F` (or `Cmd + F` on macOS).
- Items are in no particular order
- I recommend middle clicking links to open in a new tab, especially for entries with multiple links
- I also recommend bookmarking the page if you like it!

## General Piracy
- [Awesome Piracy](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy) A huge curated mega-list of piracy resources. Many of the links are outdated as the repo has been archived, but the source is incredibly invaluable none-the-less.
    - [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#readme) lists in general are very useful.
    - The author of Awesome Piracy has recommended some other mega-lists in the [repo's archival announcement](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy/issues/724), but I have yet to check them out myself.
- [Archive.org](https://archive.org/) Site used to archive a bunch of stuff. Also home of the wayback-machine. Basically the library of the internet as far as media is concerned. So much is on here it's rediculous. If you're in a collection, be sure to view all files on the right panel if you're looking for a specific file. Some may require you to sign in. A favorite of mine for roms, books, in-browser emulation, and flash games. Has tons of entries on this list.
- [Pirate Bay Mirrors](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePirateBays/comments/15hdz1y/the_pirate_bay_proxies_list_updated_august_2023/) Updated Aug 2023. List of mirror sites pulling from The Pirate Bay's database. Visiting the pirate bay directly is sketchy in my opinion, but it's database will always be invaluable. Do note however that in more recent times, their collection has become more and more unmoderated. Tred with caution. I do not recommend the subreddit's suggested VPNs. Check the VPN section below
- [TorrentGalaxy](https://torrentgalaxy.to/) Movie torrenting site. I'm using it to hold me over since RARBG went defunct. Not sure what the best alternative is yet.
- [Piracy.moe](https://piracy.moe/) Previously known as the anime index. A resource to find ways to pirate/stream anime, manga, etc. Just a good resource for weeb piracy warez.
- [Nyaa.si](https://nyaa.si/) Anime torrenting database. Probably the best out there. My first line of fire for anime piracy. [sukebei.nyaa.si](sukebei.nyaa.si) is their NSFW counterpart.
- [Soulseek](https://www.slsknet.org/) Peer-to-Peer network for (mostly) music piracy. A lot like how Limewire worked (I think? idk I was too young for it). If you're on Linux I recommend using [Nicotine+](https://nicotine-plus.org/) to access soulseek.
- [YayPonies](https://yayponies.no/) Piracy site for basically all official digital media for the My Little Pony franchise. shows, movies, comic books, bonus features, etc. They also host [other shows](https://yayponies.no/othersshow/index.php), including Bluey, Star Vs The Forces of Evil and Wander Over Yonder (as well as Ducktales and Steven Universe, albeit deprecated).
- [Microsoft Activation Scripts](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts) Microsoft supplys free download links to much of their software (including [Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11)) on their website, however they'll be unactivated "trail" versions. However, the DRM is virtually non-existant, so you can use this tool that'll just tell the software "i paid for you" and the software goes "oh ok lol". Though you should try [Linux](https://youtu.be/gJE0ukV5gFY?&t=54) if you're using it for Windows :3.

### Media Servers
- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) Basically, host your own damn netflix, with blackjack and hookers! Free open source software, lets you stream media from your own server. You can even just give family and friends the website, username, and password, and they can stream your library too. Movies, Tv, Music, as well as a group watch feature which automatically syncs the video between viewers in case you're watching online together and dont want to have to manually sync every time someone wants to pause. Supports [a ton of devices](https://jellyfin.org/clients/).
- [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) Similar to jellyfin, but with more bells, whistles, and plug-in support. Unfortunately, not open source, and contains paywalled features. I don't like it as much, but it's valid.
    - [dizquetv](https://github.com/vexorian/dizquetv) A plug-in for plex which lets you create a live "TV channel" autopopulated from content on your plex server. You could even add TV Bumpers.
    - [Retroarcher](https://github.com/RetroArcher) A plug-in for plex which also lets you stream videogames. Under heavy development. I haven't used it myself, but it seems cool.


## Videogames

### Videogame Piracy and Preservation
- [No-Intro Romsets](https://archive.org/details/no-intro_romsets) This is a database of roms available for download that match no-intro's official set. Be sure to log in and either show all files and pick which you want, or get the torrent and manage from there in your torrent manager. [No-Intro](https://no-intro.org/) is a group that basically makes the standard database for making sure your roms are clean, but they dont provide the roms themselves. 
- [Patched English Translation ROMs](https://archive.org/details/En-ROMs) English fan translations of various games, pre-patched and ready to go.
- [Vimm's Lair](https://vimm.net/?p=vault) Okay piracy site for downloading individual retro games, however limits the numbers of downloads you can have running at once, and can be quite slow. I prefer using archive.org such as the no-intro sets above.
- [Gamecube Collection by Ghostware](https://archive.org/details/GamecubeCollectionByGhostware) Full North American ISO set of gamecube games. Be sure to log in and either show all files and pick which you want, or get the torrent and manage from there in your torrent manager.
- [Wii Collection by Ghostware](https://archive.org/details/WiiRomSetByGhostware), [Part 2](https://archive.org/details/WiiRomSetByGhostwarePart2), [Part 3](https://archive.org/details/WiiRomSetByGhostwarePart3), [WiiWare/Virtual Console](https://archive.org/details/WiiWareCollectionByGhostware) Multi-part collection of commercial Wii games. Be sure to log in and either show all files and pick which you want, or get the torrent and manage from there in your torrent manager.
- [hShop](https://hshop.erista.me/) eShop replacement for 3DS with free downloads. A must install since the eShop is deprecated. Has all games that were on the eShop including updates and DLC.
- [Switch, 3DS, WiiU, PS3, PS4, Vita, Wii, WiiU, etc. piracy sites](https://rentry.org/Archive#games-download) A megalist for each. Download then install on each system with it's default backup installation method. Check Hacking & Homebrew Resources below for more info on how to install the games onto your console.
- [Old Games Finder](http://www.oldgamesfinder.com/) Search engine to find copies of old PC games. Some sites it may lead you to are paid, but not all. Use Archive.org as another line of fire.
- [r/CrackWatch](https://old.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/) Gaming piracy subreddit. Will tell you who cracked a game and removed it's DRM if a game has been cracked, which should give you enough information on where to find said cracked game. Also carries with it other useful info. Be sure to read the beginners guide on the sidebar.
- [Pirated Games Mega Thread](https://rentry.org/pgames) Lists resources curated by those at r/CrackWatch, as well as some anti-recommendations so you know what to watch out for. Anything on my list superseeds anything there (at least for me) obviously.
- [Fitgirl Repacks](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/) Repacks for modern games. (Repacks are compressed versions of games, I've rarely had problems with them though). As for other repackers, fitgirl endources RG Mechanics, RG Revenants, RG Catalyst, Xatab, El Amigos, Kapital Sin, and KaosKrew (rips). However I've never had to use them.
- [Free GOG Games](https://freegogpcgames.com/) Free release for every game on GOG.
- [Software Clearance Bin](https://archive.org/details/clearancebin) Huge collection of commercial abandonware. Not my first line of fire for seeking out a specific title, but SUPER fun to meander about and see some random shovelware game you played as a kid and go "omg I'm gonna pop this in".
- [Internet Arcade](https://archive.org/details/internetarcade) A bunch of retro games are playable in browser on Archive.org. If you dont want to go through the trouble of setting up an emulator and downloading roms and you just need an instant way to check out an old game for some reason, this should be your first stop. Suprisingly good support since it uses a javascript port of MAME. Here's [Libble-Rabble](https://archive.org/details/arcade_liblrabl) as an example because I love that game.
- [Flashpoint](https://flashpointarchive.org/) A project meant to be an exhaustive preservation of flash games and animations.
    - [Flash on Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_flash) Similarly to the Internet Arcade, Archive.org also supports playing flash games in browser using [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/), which [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/) also does for flash games that have remained on the site.

### Videogame Emulation
- [Emulation Wiki](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/) A wiki on videogame emulation. Extremely useful if you want to compare and contrast features of emulators for a given console. Especially good for figuring out what the best given emulator for a console is, since especially in recent years emulators have become fairly competetive with one another.
- [Retroarch](https://www.retroarch.com/) The frontend for libretro. Nice if you want to have all your retro games in one place, navigatable with a controller, and especially useful if you're looking to use it's unique features (netplay, [shaders](https://youtu.be/mp0CF2S9N5o), etc). Download emulators as cores from within the program, scan for your games, and then run the game with their respective core. Easier than it sounds. I prefer it to standalone counterparts for most emulators, but not anything more powerful than an N64. Also sick for emulating on console, I have retroarch installed on my Switch, for example. Nintendo Switch Online emulators be damned.
     - I would like to note however, that if you do not need to use retroarch, I would avoid it. There's been a lot of claims of abusive behavior from one of the lead developers, TwinAphex. Including potentially contributing to Near's suicide, and driving devs to quit projects and leave the emu scene (such as duckstation's lead developer). I'm having trouble finding much definitive information on it all, but I'd be remiss not to mention it. Hopefully the scene creates a competetive alternative some day. If you're on mac, I'd recommend [OpenEmu](https://openemu.org/) above retroarch in many cases anyhow.
- Emulator Compatability Lists. Basically, for any given emulator, they'll list all games for the console they're emulating, and how well they're emulated. In the case of the [Dolphin Wiki](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) they'll even list optimal emulator settings, enhancements, and more for individual games.
- [Fightcade](https://www.fightcade.com/) The definitive way to play virtually every retro fighting game online. Uses a collection of emulators forked with GGPO-based rollback netcode and online matchmaking. This essentially allows for an extremely smooth online experience, and is a more modern standard for online fighting games. It also supports replays, which is a huge boon if you're trying to git good at any of these old games.
    - If you want to use rollback netcode on a non-fighting game for whatever reason, it can do that for the emulators it supports as well. Though it isn't the primary goal. At the time of writing it supports a number of MAME romset arcade games, super nintendo, and dreamcast. Check out Slippi.gg if you're interested in playing Super Smash Bros. Melee with rollback netcode.
    - You can have Fightcade automatically download roms by using lofi1048's scripts [direct-download](https://fightcade.download/fc2json.zip) (updated 04.20.2023) and extracting the archive to Fightcade's `Emulator` folder, or `~/.var/app/com.fightcade.Fightcade/data/` if you're using the linux flatpak. Once the files are extracted into the correct folder, join the desired game's respective channel and it'll download automatically. If you were already part of a channel, simply leave and re-join.
- [EmuVR](https://www.emuvr.net/) Play retro games in emulation using libretro in a VR environment. You can actually play light gun games! [showcase](https://youtu.be/cXqt2J9iJOk)! Just really cool in general. Simulated CRT televisions and atpmospheric lighting [showcase](https://youtu.be/025i3r6zjjI), netplay [showcase](https://youtu.be/xZsBaOFi9vM), and even adding videos and music as VHS, DVD, and CD objects, as well as internet tv channels. I've seen people having cartoons running in the background on a tv in one corner while they play super nintendo in the other. It's really neat.
- [VBjin-OVR](https://github.com/braindx/vbjin-ovr) Play Virtual Boy games in VR, which basically re-enables the 3D effect and the VR effect since that's what the Virtual Boy was going for. You can change the colors to black and white if you want, too. Virtual Boy Wario Land is trapped on that thing, and that game is worth playing, so yeah.

### Videogame Homebrew
- [Hacking & Homebrew resources](https://rentry.co/Guides) From the homebrew threads on 4chan's /vg/ board. Follow any guide here for it's respective console and you wont have any trouble if you have basic reading comprehension. Also provides links to piracy websites in the post-instillation sections.
    - [webcfw](https://webcfw.sdsetup.com/) Nintendo Switch Payload Loader that works in chromium browsers. For booting into cfw. Not mentioned above so I thought I'd drop it here.
- [Pretendo Network](https://pretendo.network/) 3DS and WiiU homebrew. a free replacement to nintendo's servers. Play games online, etc. Heavy WIP but extremely promising.
- [riiconnect24](https://rc24.xyz) Wii homebrew. Brings back support for utility channels, such as forecast, news, everybody votes, check mii out, and mail
- [wiimmfi](https://wiimmfi.de) Brings nintendo Wii and DS game servers back online. Mario Kart Wii is still especially popular, especially with CGTP-R which is listed below.

### Videogame Mods Enhancements and Re-Implementations
- [Rompatcher.js](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/) Some listings here are romhacks and may require you to patch a rom, use this tool to do so. I dont supply the patched rom directly because many of these update over time.
- [Sonic Adventure DX Mod Loader](https://sadxmodinstaller.unreliable.network/) Sonic Adventure DX infamously has [numerous problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SORYL5J1Heg) compared to the Dreamcast original. The Sonic Adventure Mod Loader comes bundled with a ton of fixes that bring it in line with the dream cast original, and also provides optional enhancements as well. And of course, allows you to install mods in general. Playing on PC with the mod loader is the definitive way to play Sonic Adventure.
- [Widescreen Super Mario World](https://github.com/VitorVilela7/wide-snes) Super Mario World in widescreen. 16:9, ultra-wide, you name it. [Showcase](https://youtu.be/ghAPgz-jV04), [Unpatched ROM](https://archive.org/download/super-mario-world_202204/Super%20Mario%20World%20%28U%29%20%5B%21%5D.zip)
    - [Super Nintendo SA-1 Mods](https://github.com/VitorVilela7/wide-snes) The same author makes preformance enhancement mods for various Super Nintendo games. Games like Gradius III are virtually unplayable without it. [Comparison](https://youtu.be/6SDqm7uAJa0)
- [Sonic Robo Blast 2 Kart (SRB2K)](https://mb.srb2.org/addons/srb2kart.2435/) An amazing kart racer mod for [Sonic Robo Blast 2](https://www.srb2.org/), which is a sonic fangame built using a modified version of Doom (well, Doom Legacy). It's one of the best kart racers ever made, better than most Mario Kart entries, even. Hundreds of tracks, fanmade characters, etc. Lively community. ["showcase" vid](https://youtu.be/E-jTRZ5zcFU)
- [The Mother 3 Fan Translation](https://mother3.fobby.net/) The english translation of Mother 3, featuring Tomato of Legends of Localization fame. [Unpatched ROM](https://archive.org/download/ni-roms/roms/Nintendo%20-%20Game%20Boy%20Advance.zip/Mother%203%20%28Japan%29.zip)
- [Slippi.gg](https://slippi.gg/) Super Smash Bros. Melee with online matchmaking, rollback netcode, and replays. Check out Fightcade for other fighting games. [Unpatched ISO](https://archive.org/details/super-smash-bros.-melee-v-1.02.-7z)
    - I also recommend using [Uncle Punch Training Mode](https://github.com/UnclePunch/Training-Mode/releases) which is for training. Requires the unpatched ISO.
- [Project+](https://projectplusgame.com/) Continuation of Project M, an extremely popular and famous mod of Super Smash Bros. Brawl that makes it play more like melee. Adds Roy, Mewtwo, and Knuckles to the roster. New stages, music, cosmetics. It's a better game. [Trailer](https://youtu.be/z_Hm9FBMz1M), [Unpatched ISO](https://archive.org/details/super-smash-bros.-brawl-ntsc-u-iso)
    - [Project M EX-Remix](https://forums.kc-mm.com/Gallery/BrawlView.php?Number=217920) Project+ if it was... insane? The character select screen straight up looks like some fan-wiki shit. Adds all characters from 4 and Ult, a bunch of fan characters, stages, music, etc. [great showcase video](https://youtu.be/7tpB55SPhpU). Requires the unpatched ISO.
- [TF2 Classic](https://tf2classic.com/) A free Sourcemod that aims to re-imagine the 2008/2009 era of Team Fortress 2. New features range from weapons and maps to gamemodes such as VIP and Four-Team.
- [CGTP-R](https://www.chadsoft.co.uk/) A widely installed mod for Mario Kart Wii with a lively online community via wiimmfi Adds over 200 new tracks to the game. [2019 Trailer](https://youtu.be/8R7B51s74WA)
- [Super Mario War (SMWStuff Continuation)](https://github.com/mmatyas/supermariowar) A fan-made multiplayer Super Mario Bros. style deathmatch game in which players try to beat one another in a variety of gameplay modes. Super fun party game. Basically, Duck Game before Duck Game, with goomba stomps. If you're not sold [here's a video showcasing the game and talking about it's history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqS7ad_BFg4)
- [Power Bomberman](https://www.bombermanboard.com/viewtopic.php?t=1925) A feature-rich Bomberman fangame. supports up to 12 players, has over 650 characters, over 70 stages, and an unpresedented level of settings to tweak.
- [Pokemon Unbound](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=382178) My favorite pokemon game is a rom-hack. Idk how to feel about it either. It's a "Fire Red romhack", but I'd sonner consider it a campaign made in gen 3's engine. Backported pokemon, mega evolutions, a great campaign. It's awesome. [Unpatched ROM](https://archive.org/details/1636PokemonFireRedUSquirrels)
- [romhacking.net](https://www.romhacking.net/) Basically the website that hosts romhacks, save for romhacking.com and game/franchise dedicated fourms (such as for Pokemon). 
- [romhacking.com](https://romhacking.com/) Website that hosts romhacks primarily for Super Mario 64. Founded and owned by YouTuber/Twitch Streamer SimpleFlips. They offer a launcher that lets you run n64 hacks from the website. [Unpatched Super Mario 64 ROM](https://archive.org/details/super-mario-64-u_202101)
    - [B3313](https://romhacking.com/hack/b3313-super-mario-64-internal-plexus) A beta-based Super Mario 64 hack. Every copy is personalized. Don't spoil yourself. Use the abandoned version.
    - [60fps Hack (Optional Widescreen)](https://romhacking.com/hack/60-fps-patch) A hack to get Super Mario 64 to run in 60fps, and optionally widescreen as well. Though I'd sooner recommend the PC port. [Showcase](https://youtu.be/L_pYhVo2mEo)
    - [Kaze's Profile](https://romhacking.com/user/Kaze) Kaze is an extremely talented romhacker for SM64. He's the author behind star road, chaos edition, and the afformationed 60fps mod. Sort by most downloaded if you're interested. His [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/kazeemanuar) has some super interesting showcases, behind the scenes, and more as well.
- [Sonic 1 Forever and Sonic 2 Absolute](https://teamforeveronline.wixsite.com/home) Modified versions of the official 2013 remakes for Sonic 1 and 2. This is possible thanks to the [decompilation](https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/Sonic-1-2-2013-Decompilation) This is the definitive way to play both games. You'll need either the [Data.rsdk files](https://archive.org/details/s1and2data) or an apk of each game. [Sonic 1 apk](https://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(2013_game)), [Sonic 2 apk](https://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_2_(2013))
- [Sonic CD 2011 Decompilation](https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/Sonic-CD-11-Decompilation/releases/latest) A decompilation of the official 2011 remake. You'll need the [Data.rsdk](https://archive.org/details/data_20230512) file to play. here's a [tutorial](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/14111) if you need help. Either the base decomp or using [Sonic CD Restored](https://gamebanana.com/mods/50089) (a mod for the decomp) is the definitive way to play.
- [Sonic 3 A.I.R.](https://sonic3air.org/) A fan-made widescreen remaster of Sonic 3 & Knuckles. The definitive way to play. The [S3&K.bin](https://archive.org/details/sonic-knuckles-w-sonic-3) from the steam release is required to play.
- [Super Mario 64 PC Port Info](https://www.sm64pc.info) a website hosting info on Super Mario 64's [PC Port](https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64-port), which is based on the game's [decomp](https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64). The pc port allows the game to play natively on pc in 60fps and widescreen, rather than in emulator. Lets you use a number of other enhancements as well. [Unpatched Super Mario 64 ROM](https://archive.org/details/super-mario-64-u_202101).
    - [Project SGI / Render96](https://github.com/Render96/Render96ex/wiki) A gorgeous mod for the PC Port that makes the game look like the Silicon Graphics Inc. 1996 renders (such as the game's boxart). When following the tutorial use the [latest](https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases/tag/nightly-x86_64) version of MSYS2 instead of the one they link to directly. Check out this [showcase](https://youtu.be/Lav8wgQP9rc)
- [OpenRCT2](https://openrct2.org/) An open-source re-implementation of Chris Sawyer's Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, however it also allows you to play RCT1 scenerios if you provide a copy of RCT1. Extremely good in countless ways. Requires a copy of the original game. [RCT2 iso](https://archive.org/details/roller-coaster-tycoon-2-triple-thrill-pack), [RCT iso](https://archive.org/details/roller-coaster-tycoon-deluxe).
- [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org/) An open-source simulation game based on Chris Sawyer's Transport Tycoon Deluxe. You can provide a copy of the original TTD for original graphics and sound. [TTD iso](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Transport_Tycoon_Deluxe_1995)
- [Crispy Doom](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom) is my preferred way to play DOOM and DOOM II. It's a fork of the sourceport [Chocolate Doom](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom). There isn't really a definitive way to play Doom, but this is very good if you want to preserve the original experience with higher resolution, framerate, mouse look, better controls, etc. Do not enable jump or free vertical looking. [Dwars' Overviews](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6Iguf8T_ie8SJUvv4Mt3XpSFgufOBVF) are a good watch if you want more info on sourceport options out there (albeit maybe outdated).
    - You'll need the [.wad files](https://archive.org/details/2020_03_22_DOOM) to play. You'll want to get The Ultimate Doom, Doom II Hell On Earth 1.9, and optionally Doom II No Rest For The Living BFG edition, then go from there.
    - [Roland SC-55 Music Packs](https://sc55.duke4.net/) This site provides music packs meant to emulate the sound of an SC-55. If you're using Crispy Doom, be sure to download the config files for it. The Roland SC-55 was a sound module released in 1991, and is widely considered to provide the best sound for DOS games. I'm not sure why Crispy Doom doesn't replicate it by default. [Comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9IRWOzs0T0)
    - Doom has a complicated release history, so i recommend cross-referencing the [Doom Wiki](https://doomwiki.org) just in case to make sure you're getting the version of the game you prefer. Later re-releases had more levels for example.
    - [GZDoom](https://zdoom.org/index) is a sourceport which is good for every modded doom wad, especially since many wads dont support other sourceports. Change texture filtering to none in the options. [Doomworld 25 Years](https://www.doomworld.com/25years/) is a good place to start to discover modded wads, as is their Cacowards ceremony. My favorite wad is [MyHouse.wad](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/134292-myhousewad/). I also quite like [Treasure Tech](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=66995). I have not played many custom wads.
    - [SIGIL](https://romero.com/sigil) Doom's 5th episode, which was designed by John Romero for Doom's 25th anniversary. I recommend you grab the buckethead version from the .wad files link above. I'm giving it it's own bullet because it feels like it deserves it's own mention, and also because he made it for GZDoom, albeit Crispy Doom supports it.
    - The [Playstation port](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRcFCkXbdGI) of Doom is also incredibly interesting as it's a very different but cool take on the game. May as well also mention Doom 64 has mouse controls now since it's good, but that's a different game.
    - So long as we're here... [Action Button Reviews Doom](https://youtu.be/38zduHkwGcc) is the best video/retrospective/overview of the game to ever exist. S-Tier vid.

### Videogame Misc.
- [My Life In Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/@mylifeingaming) A youtube channel dedicated to retro games. I mention them specifically for their RGB series, which extensively details ways to get the best possible picture out of your retro consoles. There are broad episodes, episodes focused on specific consoles, and episodes focused on specific equipment
- [TheBackloggery](https://www.backloggery.com/) Sort of like MAL for videogames. You can detail what games you own, how you own them, and if you've played, beaten, completed, or mastered them.
- [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/) Database of cover assets for Steam, since a lot of games are missing covers and the like. Includes non-steam games as well, in case you put those in your steam library.
    - [Steam Rom Manager](https://github.com/SteamGridDB/steam-rom-manager) Useful for bulk adding non-steam games (such as retro games) to your steam library with image assets pulled from SteamGridDB
- [Sudomemo](https://www.sudomemo.net/) Brings the DSi's flipnote hatena service back online with community-run servers, has support for both DSi and 3DS! People are posting great stuff! [Example 1](https://x.com/Sudomemo/status/1619133335892271105), [Example 2](https://x.com/Sudomemo/status/1614080179311366146), [Example 3](https://x.com/parrygripp/status/1591189786555224064)
    - [Sudomemo Archive](https://archive.sudomemo.net) An archive of virtually every flipnote ever that was on the flipnote hetena servers when it shut down.
    - [Kaeru World](https://gallery.kaeru.world) is ran by a different team. Same idea as sudomemo, but for Flipnote's sequel Flipnote 3D. Less active, still cool.
- [Death Generator](http://deathgenerator.com/) Also known as Sierra Text Generator. Lets you create custom text boxes in the style of a ton of different games.
- [NoClip](https://noclip.website/) Lets you look around 3D environments in browser for a ton of games you absolutely played growing up as if you were using noclip in source.
- [Earthbound Battle Backgrounds](https://www.gjtorikian.com/Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds-JS/) Generator for moving earthbound backgrounds.
- [Super Lesbian Animal RPG](https://slarpg.com/) SLARPG doesn't really belong here but fuck you it's my list. Everyone must play this. An RPGMaker game by Ponnet (aka Bobby), the author of [Thanks Ken Penders](https://www.tumblr.com/thankskenpenders). With [music](https://beatrixquinn.bandcamp.com/album/super-lesbian-animal-rpg-ost) by Beatrix Quinn. Give it a shot if you like "quirky earthbound inspired RPGs" or gay people. Fuck elden ring, it's my GOTY 2022. Be sure to read the (short) [official prologue comic](https://slarpg.com/comic) before you start.
    - Bobby recommends joy2key if you want to use a controller. Do NOT do this. Use steam input with community uploaded profiles (or make your own). If you don't own the game on steam, add it as a non-steam game. Also, dont play on 1.5x or 2x unless you really need to fill the screen, it stretches the pixels (blame RPGMaker for both of these limitations.). If you read this far, there's sort of an easter egg if you try to go to melody's real tumblr page featured her in-game laptop :3


## Privacy
- [Privacy Guides](https://privacyguides.org/) Basically the authority in protecting your privacy and making your digital life more secure, in my opinion.
- [Techlore](https://www.youtube.com/c/Techlore) A YouTube channel that posts super helpful recommendations and guides on all things privacy. Also hosts a weekly show called [Surveillance Report](https://www.youtube.com/surveillancereport) ([old episodes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3KeV6Ui_4CZemCIsHUIuEtugAmUxAYHS))which recaps news and important events in the quickly everchanging world of privacy. They also have a [website](https://techlore.tech).
- [FOSS Front-Ends](https://gitlab.com/FSMdotCOM/foss-front-ends-and-alternatives) Free Open Source Software alternatives to and tools to various popular services, such as many social media platforms.
- [ArouraStore](auroraoss.com) A FOSS alternative to the Play Store. Lets you download apps from the playstore without signing in to Google, and without giving Google any real data about you. Also includes a section under every app showing how many trackers it has if they've been reported to the database. It is available on F-Droid.
- [Insular](https://gitlab.com/secure-system/Insular) A FOSS app that sandboxes apps you select into a seperate profile which can be turned on and off. Good for keeping apps which you dont trust to send as little data about you as possible, as well as make sure they're all turned off entirely when insular's profile is turned off. It is available on F-Droid.
- [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/) A FOSS app that lets you watch YouTube on your phone without signing in to Google. It also allows you to download videos, listen to them in the background, skip ads, and skip sponsored segments. Basically everything YouTube Preimum offers and more. Also supports bandcamp and soundcloud for music streaming.
- [ReVanced](https://revanced.app/) A manager to apply mods to various android apps. Especially useful to remove ads on apps like YouTube. Most people prefer this over NewPipe since it lets you use the actual YouTube app (or any other apps it modifies).
- [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) Privacy focused Google alternative. Don't "Google it", ask your duck!
- [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail) Privacy focused e-mail service. Their frontpage is a little bit misleading about what it can do, and quite frankly e-mail just is plain not a private protocol, but at least they're not selling your data. Will not protect you from feds (no e-mail service will). 
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) Best password manager that I know of. Free, secure, private, and functional.


### VPNs
- All entries in this section are taken from [This Techlore Video](https://youtu.be/cpjYN8Q7Mz8)
- [Do you really need a VPN?](https://i.imgur.com/VO7aob6.png) An infographic from IVPN's site.
- [CalyxVPN](https://calyxinstitute.org/projects/digital-services/vpn) A free and private VPN. It and Riseup are the only free VPNs I trust. Unfortunately only has 1 location and can be slow. F-Droid app is available.
- [RiseupVPN](https://riseup.net/en/vpn) A free and Private VPN. It and CalyxVPN are the only free VPNs I trust. Unfortunately has few locations and can be slow. F-Droid app is available.
- [IVPN](https://www.ivpn.net/) Fast, private, no bullshit VPN that openly tells you what a VPN is and isn't good for and if you actually need one. Transparency reports, warrant canaries, 2FA, the works. Supports Wireguard. Email-less signup option. They have no affiliate plan. Many people who know what they're talking about consider it the best. Go with this or ProtonVPN, whichever gives you better speeds to be honest. Priced at $60/yr for standard and $100/yr for pro.
- [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/) Fast, private, no bullshit VPN. Transparency reports, warrant canaries, the works. No 2FA, unfortunately. Many people who know what they're talking about also consider it the best as well. Go with this or IVPN, whichever gives you better speeds to be honest. Ran by the ProtonMail team. Priced at $48/yr for basic and $96/yr for preimum at the time of writing.
- [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net) Great, but no transparency report, no warrant canaries, no 2FA. Otherwise fast and no bullshit VPN. Priced at €5/mo ($5.46/mo), which translates to €60/yr ($65.54/yr).


## Addons

### Browser Extensions
- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) Adblocker, malware blocker, and tracker blocker. Blocks the visible AND invisible shittyness that comes with ads and other bullshit like them. A must install.
- [Image Search Options](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/image-search-options/) Reverse image searcher, super useful since google doesn't always give you the image you're looking for.
- [Sponsorblock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) Skip youtube sponsors. Works better than you'd think it would. Also offers options to skip recaps, non-music sections of music videos, self-promo, and more.
- [Annotations Restored](https://github.com/isaackd/AnnotationsRestored) Restores archived YouTube annotations. I only use this when I know a video used to have annotations and hope they were preserved.
- [OneTab](https://www.one-tab.com/) Save a ton of ram and clean up your tab bar with a single click. It'll roll all (or individual) tabs into a single tab as a list. It's OP, a must have for tab hoarders like myself.
- [DarkReader](https://darkreader.org/) A quick way to make websites dark which dont have a dark theme. Though i'd still recommend native dark themes for websites if they support the feature, as sometimes dark reader can hide elements which are supposed to be visible. Able to be toggled on a per-website basis, and toggleable with a hotkey.
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) An extension that lets you load userscripts. Think of them like modifications to websites, without being their own full extension. If an extension has a userscript version, jump for it. Your ram will thank you. You can find userscripts I use below.
- [Indie Wiki Buddy](https://getindie.wiki/) Fuck Fandom Wiki! If a community has an independant wiki not hosted on fandom, this extension gives you options to add a redirect link, automatically redirect you, and/or remove fandom-hosted wiki results from search engines. Here's a list of wikis they support [list](https://getindie.wiki/listings/). For wikis that are still on Fandom, it also gives you options to view those wikis on aternative frontends like Breezewiki.
    - Unfortunately, it doesn't auto-redirect wikis that have moved to [wiki.gg](https://wiki.gg/wikis/), but you can check their wiki list (linked) for wikis they host. Wiki.gg hosts a collection of gaming wikis and was created by a former Fandom and Gamepedia staff pair. It's essentially Gamepedia 2. It's not independant but anything is preferable to fandom.

### Userscripts
- [Tampermonkey scripts list](https://www.tampermonkey.net/scripts.php) Page listing resources for finding new userscripts.
- [4chan X](https://www.4chan-x.net/) Chan boards it supports are basically unusable without it. Thread watcher, view full image on hover, board hotbar, catalogue default, keybinds. It's OP.
- [Anti Adblock Killer](https://reek.github.io/anti-adblock-killer/) You know those pop-ups you get sometimes when using an adblocker? This helps to get rid of those. Install and forget.
- [Chrome Dark Scrollbar and Audio Player](https://userstyles.org/styles/108298) I was having trouble getting chrome themes to have a dark scrollbar, so here's a userscript for getting a dark scrollbar on chrome.
- [BetterTTV](https://betterttv.com/) More emotes, features, etc for twitch. Select "other" browser even if your browser is supported for the userscript.

### Discord Modifications
- [Rebane's Discord Color Text Generator](https://rebane2001.com/discord-colored-text-generator/) NOT an addon, just a website that lets you generate colored text for discord. [Here's a video explaining it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtdOJCEIpvQ)
- [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) Betterdiscord is a modified client for Discord on desktop. The below plugins are for it.
- [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/) Another modified desktop client. However, this one comes bundled with all of it's plugins, and the plugins can be enabled and disabled as you wish. Has it's own pros and cons.
- [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord) Aliucord is a modified client for Discord on mobile. You need to [join their server](https://discord.gg/EsNDvBaHVU) if you want access to their plugins as they're stored there in a convienet to download way. I'm also told it helps with tracking and privacy, but I have yet to verify that.
- [BetterDiscord Plugins](https://betterdiscord.app/plugins) The plugins section of the betterdiscord website, obviously you can find more plugins here.
- [Discord Experiments](https://github.com/Inve1951/BetterDiscordStuff/blob/master/plugins/discordexperiments.plugin.js) Lets you toggle on and off discord beta features in a new tab of your user-settings. This is a feature made for discord beta testers which isn't a very well kept secret. Highly recommend toggling "Activities Experiment" to "all activities" so you can play Poker, Chess, and watch YouTube all within a discord call.  
- [BDFDB](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Library/) Required Library for a lot of plugins made by DevilBro, who's heavily involved and very prolific in the scene. A lot of plugins are dependant on it.
- [Zere's Plugin Library](https://github.com/rauenzi/BDPluginLibrary) Gives other plugins utility functions and emulation capability. A lot of plugins are dependant on it.
- [Do Not Track](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/DoNotTrack) HELPS to stop discord from invading your privacy. Know that discord by it's design is not privacy friendly. Mark my words, there will come a day that discord's data leaks and all their plaintext messages become public, your DMs included.
- [Favorite Media](https://github.com/Dastan21/BDAddons/blob/main/plugins/FavoriteMedia) Lets you "star" all types of media, whereas discord only supports gif for some reason.
- [Discord Free Emojis](https://github.com/An00nymushun/DiscordFreeEmojis) If you dont have nitro, will re-enable the emoji picker/typing, and paste the emoji as image links.
- [Image Utilities](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/ImageUtilities/) Adds image features like gallery, zoom, reverse image search, and more.
- [Notification Sounds](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/NotificationSounds/) Lets you set custom sounds for basically anything that makes a sound in discord (calling, messaging, connecting, disconnecting, muting, everything)
- [Better Folders](https://github.com/Zerthox/BetterDiscord-Plugins) Lets you create icons for folders. This page also includes links to a few other of the author's plugins.
- [Better Role Colors](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/BetterRoleColors) Adds server-based role colors to typing, voice, popouts, modals, etc.
- [Call Time Counter](https://github.com/QWERTxD/BetterDiscordPlugins/tree/main/CallTimeCounter) Shows you how long you've been in a call
- [Clickable Mentions](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/ClickableMentions/) Allows you to open a User Popout by clicking a Mention in your Message Input
- [Gif Saver](https://github.com/bepvte/bd-addons) Backs up your favorited gifs and restores them if discord removes them. Doesn't work for other media favorited with Favorite Media i dont believe. Link also includes some other addons made by the author.
- [Hide Channels](https://github.com/CapnKitten/BetterDiscord/tree/master/Plugins/HideChannels) Lets you minimize the channel list so that the chat takes up more window space.
- [Last Message Date](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/LastMessageDate/) Displays the Last Message Date of a Member for the current Server/DM
- [Link Profile Picture](https://github.com/Inve1951/BetterDiscordStuff/blob/master/plugins/linkProfilePicture.plugin.js) Lets you click users' avatars on their profile page to view a bigger version in your browser
- [Link Banner](https://github.com/Echological/LinkBanner-BD/blob/856988b26db0e7c1c3895931a3735cd7b6ac0211/LinkBanner.plugin.js) Same thing as above but for a user's banner.
- [Member Count](https://github.com/Arashiryuu/crap/tree/master/ToastIntegrated/MemberCount) Lets you easily see how many members a server has.
- [Open Steam Links In App](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/OpenSteamLinksInApp/) Steam links will open in steam instead of in browser
- [Quick Delete Messages](https://github.com/Inve1951/BetterDiscordStuff/blob/master/coffee/QuickDeleteMessages.plugin.coffee) Hold the delete key and click a message to delete it.
- [Split Large Messages](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/SplitLargeMessages) if you type more characters than discord lets you send in one message, it'll cut it, then automatically send the rest of what the message would have been in a second message, and a 3rd, and so on.
- [Spotify Listen Along](https://github.com/ordinall/BetterDiscord-Stuff/tree/master/Plugins/SpotifyListenAlong/) Allows using the listen along feature without preimum.
- [Typing Indicator](https://github.com/l0c4lh057/BetterDiscordStuff/tree/master/Plugins/TypingIndicator) adds an indicator for when someone is typing in a channel or server without having to look at the channel.


## Programs
- [qBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) Torrenting client. The only one worth a damn.
- [JDownloader](https://jdownloader.org/) Download manager. Scrape websites, read the clipboard for links to downloads, etc. Have them all in a neat list. Especially useful for archive.org collections or for when you have a slow internet connection.
- [Handbreak](https://handbrake.fr/) Video transcoder. Compress, convert, etc. Throw videos in and choose which format you want and watch the filesize shrink.
- [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) Best screenshot software there is. Still sad there isn't a linux version.
- [Open Broadcast Software (OBS)](https://obsproject.com/) Best video recording, screen recording, and streaming software there is. Pretty self-explanitory.
- [List of Adobe Alternatives](https://twitter.com/XdanielArt/status/1434611199140896772) Sick list of alternatives to adobe suite software. Useful for linux or if you just hate adobe (But, of course, pirating their software will always be moral :P )
- [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) Command line program for downloading vids from youtube and [others](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html), including mp3s and thumbnails. No more "youtube download mp3" searching for you. Albeit, if you insist on using a website, you can try finding an [AllTube](https://github.com/Rudloff/alltube) instance. It lets you host a website that uses youtube-dl for it's backend. If you dont want to use command line, you can also get [youtube-dl GUI](https://github.com/jely2002/youtube-dl-gui).


## Cool Stuff
- [15.ai](https://15.ai/) Accurate text to speech generator which mimicks characters from multiple franchises. Has a history of going down for a long time to be worked on, released for a short period, and so on. So make what you need while you have the chance.
- [PetPet](https://benisland.neocities.org/petpet/) Tool for creating those petting gifs memes. 
- [KidPix](https://kidpix.app/) A port of KidPix to browser
- [Microsoft Paint](https://paint.js.org/) A javascript remake of Microsoft Paint to browser
- [Nostalgic Kids' Sites](http://nostalgiakidssites.com/) An archival project managed by [Rare Noggin Stuff](https://www.youtube.com/c/RareNogginStuff) that's dedicated to hosting 00's and 10's websites aimed at pre-school children. Hosts snapshots of Nick Jr., Nick Jr. Playtime, PBS Kids, and PBS Sprout at the time of writing.
- [Neal.fun](https://neal.fun/) Cool little distractions by [a guy named Neal](https://twitter.com/nealagarwal). [Absurd Trolley Problems](https://neal.fun/absurd-trolley-problems/) is a good start I think. [The Password Game](https://neal.fun/password-game/) blew up when it released, but i had the site listed before then B)
- [3DMM Source Code](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-3D-Movie-Maker) Microsoft made 3DMM open source. You may know of 3DMM from [Jerma's Rat Movie Duology](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ4mmygFKYHKncd4PiyM5giwXp_owEKj3) or [Vinesauce Joel's Blue Shell Incident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUT2kKZeUpo)
- [Radio Garden](https://radio.garden) Shows you a map of the world, where pins on the world are local radio stations you can listen to.


## Other
- [diyhrt.wiki](https://diyhrt.wiki/) Do It Yourself Horomone Replacement Therapy. Especially useful if the system is failing you (underdosing, gatekeeping, waitlisting), but even barring that it's an alternative to be considered to give you more control over your transition and possibly even save you some dosh. Both feminizing and masculinizing horomone replacements are covered. Also just a good resource for learning about hrt and it's effects in general (which you really ought to do. Most doctors do not have the time or need to research the ins and outs of transition, and are... safe but surprisingly very ignorant).
- [TheraminTrees](https://www.youtube.com/@TheraminTrees) a YouTube channel explores issues around abuse, manipulation, dogma, and systems of undue influence. Hosted by a licenced therapist. Life-changing stuff inside.
- [Catbox.moe](https://catbox.moe/) A nice, free, minimum bullshit image and file cloud. Also check out [Litterbox](https://litterbox.catbox.moe/) for hosting files which are temporary in nature and can just be deleted whenever (this is a homegrown project ran at a loss most months, be nice and be reasonable).
- [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) A free "remake" of Adobe Photoshop in browser. Works better than it has any right to. Use [Photopea Adblock](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/422431-anti-anti-adblock-on-photopea-com) as well (i had to change the value in the script to 320). uBlock already blocks ads on photopea, but the space is still reserved for the ad. Using this will fill the whole screen and remove the adspace. This is a [userscript](#userscripts).
- [Sumo](https://sumo.app/) Similar to Photopea in that it's a suite of creation tools that run in browser. Has apps for paint, pixelart, music, audio, video, code, 3D, and photos. Check the app dropdown menu at the top banner of the page. I'll be honest, I dont use it myself, but someone recommended it to me and it seems nice.
- [IsThereAnyDeal](https://isthereanydeal.com) Key sites like G2A are shady and fuck over developers, but there's a load of second-party official key sellers (ex. Humble Bundle) that don't and still get you a deal on your games. This site is basically a live database for those, so just check it when you're wanting to buy a new game and you may save yourself a few bones
- [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/) A website dedicated to harm-reduction and education for a number of drugs. Includes sitable and non-sitable information (such as personal experiences, opinion pieces, media writings, etc., etc.,)
- [MyTime.io](https://mytime.io/) great for creating one link that a bunch of people in different timezones can use to coordinate. Basically, you format the url as something like mytime.io/13:00/PT or mytime.io/1pm/PT to have 1pm PT conveted into your timezone automatically. It'll give the correct time for anyone connecting. Be sure to turn off your VPN and tell everyone else to as well for it to work!
- [Just The Recipe](https://www.justtherecipe.com/) Paste in a recipe from a recipe site and remove all of their bullshit lifestories and clutter
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) A website you're probably using wrong. It's invaluable for finding information within or about a given hobby, product, or niche. Tired of shitty listicles you get from your search engine when you just want to know what a good xyz is? Or how to fix a problem? or-- Reddit. Literally just add `site:reddit.com` to your searches (or whatever the format is in your favorite search engine is) and you'll get better results.
- [Mycroft Project](https://mycroftproject.com/) typing into the omnibar in firefox to do a search shows little buttons at the bottom labeled "search this time with" with icons for various websites. This feature should be self explanitory, click the amazon button, search with amazon. If you do this on a website, if they support it, you can add that website's search feature to that list in your omnibar. Mycroft allows people to write scripts for websites that dont support this. I use this for SteamGridDB as well as HowLongToBeat, for example.
